          <h1>Overview</h1>
          <p>
            As we are in the digital era, security is of paramount importance
            due to several factors:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Pervasive Connectivity</li>
            <li>Data Proliferation</li>
            <li>Rapid Technological Advancements</li>
            <li>Globalization and Remote Work</li>
            <li>Cybercrime and Threat Landscape</li>
            <li>Regulatory Compliance and Data Privacy</li>
            <li>Trust and Reputation</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Security is vital to mitigate cybersecurity risks, protect sensitive
            data, comply with regulations, maintain trust and reputation, and
            ensure the resilience of digital infrastructure and services.
            Organizations must adopt a proactive and holistic approach to
            cybersecurity to address the evolving threats and challenges of the
            digital landscape effectively.

            Ethical Hacking, also known as white-hat hacking, involves
            authorized attempts to bypass security measures to identify
            vulnerabilities. It's primary goal is to improve the security
            posture of systems and networks by uncovering weaknesses before
            malicious attackers exploit them.

          <h1>Steganography</h1>
          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            Steganography is the practice of concealing secret information
            within an ordinary, non-secret file or message in order to avoid
            detection. Unlike cryptography, which focuses on securing the
            contents of a message, steganography aims to hide the existence of
            the message itself. The word "steganography" is derived from the
            Greek words "steganos"(covered) and "graphie"(writing).
          </p>

          <h3>History</h3>
          <p>
            Steganography has a long history dating back to ancient times when
            secret messages were hidden in wax tablets or tattooed onto the
            shaven heads of messengers. During World War ll, invisible ink and
            microdots were used for covert communication.
          </p>

          <h3>Techniques</h3>
          <p>Common steganography techniques include -</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Least Significant Bit(LSB) insertion : Altering the least
              significant bits of pixels in an image or audio file to encode
              hidden information.
            </li>
            <li>
              Spread Spectrum : Embedding data by slightly modifying the colour
              or amplitude of pixels or samples in digital media.
            </li>
            <li>
              Text-based steganography : Concealing messages within whitespace,
              formatting, or other non-printing characters in text documents.
            </li>
            <li>
              File-based steganography : Hiding data within the structure of
              files, such as adding extra space between letters in a document.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Detection</h3>
          <p>
            Detecting steganography poses significant challenges due to the
            subtle nature of hidden data. Specialized steganalysis techniques,
            such as statistical analysis, anomaly detection, and visual
            inspection,are employed to detect the presence of hidden information
            in digital media.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, steganography is a powerful and evolving technique for
            covert communication and data hiding in the digital age, with
            implications for security, privacy, and forensic investigation.

            It refers to a part of the internet that is not indexed by
            traditional search engines and requires special software or

            <u>A Complete Guide to Web Development for Aspiring Coders</u>
          </h1>
          <br />
          <h1>What is Web Development?</h1>
          <p>
            Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites.
            It encompasses everything from creating a simple static webpage to
            building complex web applications that interact with databases and
            users in real-time. It’s a field that combines creativity, logic,
            and technology, making it an attractive choice for students who
            enjoy problem-solving and building digital experiences.
          </p>
          <h1>Technologies in Web Development</h1>
          <h2>1. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</h2>
          <p>
            HTML is the foundation of any web page. It defines the structure and
            layout of content on the web. Think of HTML as the skeleton of a
            website, organizing elements like headings, paragraphs, and images
            in a logical order. Learning HTML is the first step to becoming a
            web developer.
          </p>
          <h2>2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h2>
          <p>
            CSS makes your website look good. It’s responsible for styling your
            HTML content—things like colors, fonts, and layouts. CSS allows you
            to create responsive, visually appealing designs that look great on
            any screen size, from mobile phones to desktops.
          </p>
          <h2>3. JavaScript (JS)</h2>
          <p>
            Once your website looks good, JavaScript adds functionality to it.
            With JS, you can create interactive elements like forms, buttons,
            animations, and much more. It’s a dynamic scripting language that
            runs directly in the browser, giving users a seamless experience.
          </p>
          <h2>4. React.js</h2>
          <p>
            React.js is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces,
            especially single- page applications. It’s incredibly fast and
            scalable, making it one of the most popular tools among developers.
            React simplifies the process of creating complex UIs with reusable
            components.
          </p>
          <h2>5. Node.js</h2>
          <p>
            On the backend, Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows
            developers to run JS on the server. With Node.js, you can build
            scalable, high-performance web applications that handle many users
            at once. It’s widely used for building APIs and handling backend
            logic.
          </p>
          <h2>6. SQL & MongoDB</h2>
          <p>
            When dealing with databases, SQL (Structured Query Language) is used
            for relational databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL, while MongoDB is
            a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.
            Both have their strengths depending on the project you’re working
            on.
          </p>
          <hr />

          <h1>My Journey in Web Development</h1>
